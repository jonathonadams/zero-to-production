      <p>
        We have all seen a Todo App before but this demonstrates how a well
        structured monorepo can make your code highly reusable.
      </p>

      <p>
        A monorepo has many benefits, one if which is code sharing of libraries.
        The Todo Application below is it's own standalone application of which
        almost all of its code base is comprised of imported libraries that
        together makes up the application (Auth, Dashboard, Todos etc). As the
        application itself is just another library, it can be imported into
        other applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        For further information about monorepo design principles have a look at
        the information and tools from the team at

      <h4>API Server</h4>
      <p>
        The app below is a complete working web app communicating with a live
        GraphQL API as provided in this monorepo (<em>apps/server/*</em>). The
        API is configured to run in either Docker & Kubernetes or as a
        serverless cloud function. The servers found in
        <em>apps/server/api</em> & <em>apps/server/lambda</em> are currently
        hosted and Google Cloud Kubernetes & AWS Lambda respectively and can be
        toggled below.

      <h4>NOTE</h4>
      <p>
        You will have to register before you can log in. For privacy reasons the
        API has been configured to accept dummy data (so not to collect any
        sensitive information). The email address you provide does
        <b>NOT</b> have to be unique and will note be 'verified' so go ahead and
        put <b>test@email.com</b> or similar as it only needs to satisfy the
        email validation. Your username is the only thing required to be unique
        for registration to be successful.

        The Database will be wiped regularly so don't be surprised if you come
        back next week and its all gone.
